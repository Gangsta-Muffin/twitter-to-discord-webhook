# webhook-for-ateam

# This Webhook was made for a streamer's discord community, following the game "Battlefield"
#

# If you wish to use this code, you must apply for you own consumer keys and access tokens at: https://developer.twitter.com/en
# You will also need to get your own Webhook id and token from your discord webhook

# To get the id and token from your Webhook, copy the url and past it somewhere. The Id and Token will be in the link in the following Format:
# "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/ID/TOKEN"

# The Project version and the Replit version do not have any difference, other than the Replit version being able to run 24/7
# If you decide to run the replit version 24/7, you will need to set up an external monitor for it to run 24/7. I used https://uptimerobot.com/ but the choice is yours


# Lastly, using this code, you will want to change the "screen_name" in each link to the account you wish to have the webhook follow.
# To do this, go to each Link in the code and swap "BattlefieldComm" to the name of the account you wish to follow (must be the @ name of the user)
